<p>When Seu talks about defamiliarizing our tools, I believe she is talking about taking digital tools and presenting them in unconventional manners that make us think about their intentions and purpose.  I think this action relates to poetry because you can communicate and express ideas when you defamiliarize digital tools.</p>
<p>The category “Removing Function from Form” involves taking away the intended function of elements found on a website or software (e.g. a button, scrollbar) and experimenting with them to find other interesting ways these elements can function.</p>

<p>I feel that the site ASCII Cam, works within this category because the site uses ASCII in a way that deviates from it's original function and gives it a different function, in this case, responding to what is on your webcam.</p>
