		<h1>READING RESPONSE</h1>

		<h2>1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?<br>2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.<br>3. From your own experiences interacting on the webâ€”what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</h2>

	
<div class="textGreen">
<ol>
<li>Lialaina's opinion of the word "user" varies depending on the degree of interaction and involvement between computer technology and a person. She mentions the "invisible computer" and "invisible user" which refers to how a user is aware that they are using computer technology.</li><li>Lialaina calls her opinion of an ideal internet user the "General Purpose User". The most important quality of the "General Purpose User" is someone who can achieve their task regardless of the specific tasks that a program/software was made for. She expands upon this type of user's flexibility by also calling them a "Universal User". Other qualities that Lialina outlines is that this user's mindset ables them to behave co-operatively with software.
</li>
<li>An example would be online stores, there are many "gaps" such as inputting address and shipping information, which I find the process often clunky.</li>
