			<h1>Websites as Cooking Homemade Food</h1>
		</div>
		
		<div id="recipe">
		<ul>
		<li>Like homemade food, websites are made using different “ingredients”.</li>
		<li>These ingredients being prepared with different tools similar to kitchenware, ovenware, and etc.</li>
		<li>You could use the languages CSS or Javascript to make your website background blue.</li>
		<li>Similar to how you can choose to use a knife and/or a processor to chop food.</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div id="paragraph">
		<p>Maybe you're just starting out - having little to no experience in making a website, you turn to "recipes", guidelines, and other people in how to make it. Or maybe you are a more experienced “cook” who knows recipes and rules by heart, which gives you limitless possibilites to experiment with how certain ingredients are prepared, cooked, and presented.</p>
